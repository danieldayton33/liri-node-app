<p>
  Liri is a node.js application that takes in four search parameters on the command line</p>
</br>
</br>
*spotify-this-song*: Uses Spotify API to search for song by song title </br>
*concert-this*: Uses BandinTown API to search for upcoming concerts by band name </br>
*movie-this*: Uses OMDB API to search for movies by title </br>
*do-what-it-says*: Uses fs to read a file and provide a search query from that file</br>

<p>
After providing the search type, the remaining command line entry is used to create the search (Song, Band, Movie).
