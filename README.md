Liri is a node.js application that takes in four search parameters on the command line:
*spotify-this-song: Uses Spotify API to search for song by song title </br>
*concert-this: Uses BandinTown API to search for upcoming concerts by band name </br>
*movie-this: Uses OMDB API to search for movies by title </br>
*do-what-it-says: Uses fs to read a file and provide a search query from that file.</br>

After providing the search type, the remaining command line entry is used to create the search (Song, Band, Movie).
