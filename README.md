Node.js hw assignment. This is a node.js application that takes in four search parameters on the command line:
*spotify-this-song: Uses Spotify API to search for song by song title
*concert-this: Uses BandinTown API to search for upcoming concerts by band name
*movie-this: Uses OMDB API to search for movies by title
*do-what-it-says: Uses fs to read a file and provide a search query from that file.

After providing the search type, the remaining command line entry is used to create the search (Song, Band, Movie).

Check out this video to see it in action.
